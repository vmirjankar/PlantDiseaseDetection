# Plant Disease Detection

NAME: VED VISHAL MIRJANKAR <br/>
PROJECT: BUILDING A PLANT DISEASE DETECTION USING IMAGE PROCESSING AND GAN  <br/>

ABSTRACT: <br/>
Capstone Project: Developed an automated plant disease detection system using image processing and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Researched and implemented image processing algorithms, designed and trained GAN models for accurate disease classification, and integrated system components for optimal performance. </br>
